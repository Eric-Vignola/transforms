Transforms
==========

A Numeric Transform operations toolset


About
-----

This module provides a toolset to do fast matrix/quaternion/euler/vector
operations. Calculations are made element wise over a batch, and follow NumPy's
broadcasting rules: every input must be as long as the longest one, or exactly
one, in which case it is reused for the whole batch at no memory cost.

For copy-paste recipes covering every function, see
[`CHEATSHEET.md`](CHEATSHEET.md).


Requirements
------------

Numpy, Scipy and Numba python modules.

Example
-------

    import numpy as np
    from transforms import vector_random, vector_slerp

    # declare two arrays of 10 million vectors
    V0 = vector_random(10**7)
    V1 = vector_random(10**7)

    # slerp 10 million vectors 1:1 element wise, half way
    slerp = vector_slerp(V0, V1, 0.5)

    # slerp 10 million vectors to a common vector, half way
    slerp = vector_slerp(V0, V1[0], 0.5)

    # slerp 10 million vectors 1:1 element wise, with a random ratio for each
    blend = np.random.random(10**7)
    slerp = vector_slerp(V0, V1, blend)

Rotate orders and axis indices are exported as constants:

    XYZ  YZX  ZXY  XZY  YXZ  ZYX          X  Y  Z

Five of the above -- `quaternion_log`, `quaternion_exp`, `quaternion_nlerp`,
`quaternion_intermediate` and `quaternion_squad` -- are only reachable from
`transforms.main`, not from the package root.
